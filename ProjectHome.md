A Database Management System for the Dormitories in the University of the Philippines which stores records of residents and transients. It allows user to view residents easily, edit and delete them. It also generates needed reports such as the tallies, accomplishment monthly reports, resident and transient reports separately, accounts receivable and appliance reports. The values and total fees of the said reports are automatically computed based on the existing records which can be altered any time.



Dorma is an abridged version of "DORM MANAGER SYSTEM" which lets you store and manipulate
significantly relevant records of all dormitories' residents and transients. [The records
include personal information of both the residents and transients, residents' appliance,
log, reservation, violations and key information, as well as transients' dormitory stint log.
Several important functions are also supported by the system.]
